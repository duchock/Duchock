        <div class = "content"><p>This website says a lot of things I don't say verbally.<br></p>
            <br>
            <p>I think I've already said that once before though.<br></p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>I don't reckon I've ever told anyone in my life that I love them.  At least not as long as I can remember - and certainly not in a wholesome, true-to-the-sense-of-the-word way.<br></p>
            <p>I don't know why that is.  At this point, it would almost be like breaking a perfect streak.<br></p>
            <p>I don't think it's a bad thing.  I know I feel... something that's probably love, but there's really just no value in saying something like that.  But the whole point of love is that it's relational.<br></p>
            <br>
            <p>You can't really love by yourself.  There's got to be a second party involved in some way.<br></p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>And therein lies the problem.<br></p>
            <p>How else could they know unless you tell them?<br></p>
            <p>Actions can only go so far.  So you try your best.  You still have that perpetual look on your face, but you just carry on.<br></p>
            <br>
            <p>Even though I like that look on my face.<br></p>
            <p>It's my brand.  It's comfortable.  It's more interesting than the less genuine alternative.<br></p>
            <br>
            <p>This may or may not actually be an issue.  I really have no way to tell.<br></p>
            <p>I'm quite self-aware of this reality.  But that doesn't really change the matter.<br></p>
            <p>And there's probably not a finite, objective answer to this.  I'm sure Ann Landers would have an opinion.<br></p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Despite my general nonchalance on the topic (and, well, everything), this situation weighs upon me more than most things.<br></p>
            <p>And I think I have to live with it.  It feels out of my control, like talking to strangers in public.  One's innate nature holds them back from such a simple task.<br></p>
            <p>But it's there.  It's always there.  With or without voice.</p>

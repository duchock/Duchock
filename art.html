                <strong>Year:</strong> 2008<br>
                This was my first cross-stitch I made.  Pattern most likely came from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.spritestitch.com">Sprite Stitch.</a>

                <em>Two Girls, One Up</em><br>
                <strong>Year:</strong> 2009...ish<br>
                I'm not too fond of this one.  The joke ended up being way more overdone than I expected it to be.  You can tell it was never preserved properly, and that it's been sitting in a closet since it was finished.

                <em>Ai love</em><Br>
                <strong>Year:</strong> 2010<br>
                I don't really know why I made this, neither being sentimental of the idea of love or simple patterns.  It reads "I love you" in Japanese.

                <strong>Year:</strong> 2017<br>
                This was the most ambitious but also the laziest piece I ever worked on.  It took roughly a year to finish, but mostly due to a lack of willpower than anything else.

                <strong>Year:</strong> 2018<br>
                Largest piece I've ever made.  I've played through this game several times - and it's just involved enough to be impressive, but not too large to be impossible to finish.

                    Probably the last time I will wear make-up, and the last time we wear a nightlife costume in the morning.

                        Apparently I lied when I said no more make-up.  This dress was a harsh wakeup call for my body image.

                            Materials for this costume were locally sourced.  Nobody could help us find that A train.

                        I was in need of a curtain for my glass bedroom door.  Decided to make one out of Magic the Gathering cards.  Thank you Dusty for the donation.
